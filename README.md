# explore_tiny_cpu
an educational cpu explorer command line tool to help people understand how assembly and cpus work (heavily simplified)

# why
if you are anything like me, you have probably tried to explain how cpus work to people before. now, not everyone has a background of low level programming, and for js or python programmers, it can be really hard and tiring to try to explain this stuff. this is not to shit on them, they just don't have the right background. i hope this tool makes it easier for people to understand.
